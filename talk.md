# 10 things I learned about engineering
## 10 years of my life.

Adaptation

Team is more strong than individual.

Maybe do it backwards?


First off I want to reflect on what an amazing time it is that we live in. No such thing as starting too late or not being experienced enough. We now have the tools such that you can do anything in a day that previously would’ve taken years of training to even imagine doing.


The hardest problems in engineering are often not math or science or difficult algorithms. They’re scoping problems and people problems and communication problems.



### 1: 2nd grade -- people likely don’t have context.
My best friend Barbara
People who don’t have context don’t know the full story. And as confident as they are in their assumptions, you need to make your own.
You have to always give context.


### 2: 4th grade -- always be lazy.
I also played a lot of Neopets, where I first learned to copy and paste code. I didn’t really do much with it at the time, but it was good to be familiar with these things when I first tried to make a web page sophomore year of college. 



### 3: 9th grade -- always use your resources.
Freshman year, I was a part of the Future Farmers of America. I raised pigs for competition. It was the cool thing to do at my high school.

I wasn’t going to.


### 4: 10th grade -- always be open-minded to new ideas. ???
Transferred schools.

### 5: 11th grade -- don’t be afraid to ask for things.
It’s okay to be wrong.
Crush

### 6: 12th grade -- you’re good at what you put your time into.
Maplestory. New features made everything I did obsolete. But I had to learn to deal with them.

#### So put your time into the right things.

### Also, new features will often render your hard work obsolete, but rather than resenting new things, be the one to first jump on the new things, or even better, BUILD the new things.


### 7: Freshman year -- you likely won’t get things right the first time.
Tried all the things, and discovered
What I don’t want to do

Sometimes you don’t know what the correct solution is until you try 3 wrong ones.
Don’t fret about scrapping your code. It’s not wasted time unless you think of it that way.

Triangles.

### 8: Sophomore year -- never underestimate yourself.
First hackathon.
Cisco => Google internship.

### 9: Last year -- do what you love.
Took a class I really loved

#### Don’t do what you don’t love.
More exploring. Interned at a startup, where I worked long hours because I was afraid that I’d be fired.
Open source. What I realllly want to do.

Build for developers.


### 10: Work -- a lesson in application
You’re always learning how to learn.


### 11: still learning!








A lot of really smart new grads that I've talked to have told me that they feel
like they're going to get fired for the year at their jobs.

In most cases you're not. Don't stay until 9p every night because you feel like
you need to catch up. Don't work weekends. It's most important to not burn out and be
really sad. That's the worst thing you can do for yourself.

The people who are more productive than you just know the codebase better. And
it all comes with time and a clear mind. You're working in someone else's code.

And some people argue that they felt more productive as an intern. You're
supposed to, because you're given a smaller, more isolated unit of work. You're
not obligated to refactor or clean up or generally do more janitorial work
that's involved in building inside existing code.

In fact, get used to it now. Try contributing to open source.

Amended: "I'm not as productive as my co-workers, but I'll get there soon with a
reasonable amount of work."







Hackers@Berkeley always wanted to do a "Finishathon" of sorts, because we
realized that we were never relaly following up on and finishing our hackathon
projects. We genuinely thought this was a good idea.

Mixest. I still pay $5 a month for a droplet for it. I still occasionally have
to perform upgrades and fix breakagess from changes in the last.fm api. Even
though it's old and poorly designed, it's not finished.

Then I started my own open source project. I thoguht that after release, it'd be
done. But when you have users and people contributing, it's never finished. And
it's an amazing feeling.

So I amend my belief to: "Unpopular projects can be finished. You don't want
your project to be finishable."


# 0. The most important thing I learned in school is how to code.


The most important thing I learned in school was how to learn. I learned how to
Google. I learned how to ask the right questions and read the manual when it's
appropriate. Most importantly I learned to be
responsible for what I believed in [slide](). And I learned that even with a degree,
there's so much more that I've yet to learn.



## Conclusion

You have to assume responsibility for what you believe in. Some people get
lucky, but luck favors the prepared mind. Always be alert.
